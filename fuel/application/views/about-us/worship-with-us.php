              <li><p>Service Conductors must sanctify themselves, keeping off from all impurities for three days prior to the Lord's day or any other service day - Exodus 19: 10-15.</p></li>
              <li><p>All elders, in the church should put on robes appropriate for their respective ranks, in accordance with the laid-down tenet of the church. On Sunday and New Year-day, they should all appear in their full regalia.</p></li>
              <li><p>It is very important for all literate members to cultivate the habit of reading the Bible in order to save themselves from any embarassment if and when they are called upon to read the Bible or any other book.</p></li>
              <li><p>The Bible passage should always form the theme upon which sermons will be based. Preachers must not codemn any other religion or faith. Moreover, sermons should be devoid of politics. The congregation is interested solely in listening to the word of God.</p></li>
              <li><p>Noise making, loitering and unnecessary discussions or meetings during service are abominable unto God - Ecclesiastes 5: 1-3.</p></li>
              <li><p>Members should always wear sutana that cover their nudity - Revelations 3: 18.</p></li>
              <li><p>
                Painting of lips and fingers is not allowed in the house of God. Only moderate and decent dressing and appearance is acceptable unto the Lord - Timothy 2: 9-10.
              </p></li>
              <li><p>
                During normal service, the use of musical instruments starts from the moments only organ is allowed.
              </p></li>
              <li><p>
                However during service dedicated harvest, child-naming, marriage or birthday celebrations, instruments are allowed. But everything should be done in a solemn and orderly manner. NOTE however, that irrespective of the occasion or celebrations, vocalling and musical instruments are prohibited from the time of "Yarah Sarah" to "O Christ my king".
              </p></li>
              <li><p>
                The type of service and the Bible passage to be read should be taken into consideration before selecting hymns to be sung. For example, victory songs should not be rendered in place of blessing songs and vice versa.
